# rust-visualhash
Tiny Rust crate to generate a visual fingerprint of data (like PGP keys and whatnot)

I don't know how feasible it is to generate a look-alike image, so don't count on this being ultimately secure. 
Since these images are hard to memorize, they might be most useful comparing fingerprints side-by-side. 
At that point, perhaps you'd be better off just comparing a textually encoded hash.
